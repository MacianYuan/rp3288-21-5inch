				   LibDvCDesc
			================================

	DvC Trace is part of USB Debug class which provides a way of sending
trace data via USB. The specification also defines a set of custom USB
descriptors in order to be able to share a device internal debug capabilities
(topology). This library provides an API that helps converting these descriptors
in various formats:

1) binary
	The same way the descriptors are presented by an USB gadget as part of
	the standard USB descriptors.

2) binary-hex
	The format used by DvC-Trace gadget function driver to expose topology
	descriptors via sysfs:
	(<kernel>/Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-bus-dvctrace)

3) config
	A custom json like format. An example can be found in sample/npk.cfg.
	The language used tries to be as close as possible to the structure
	definition provided by the spec.
